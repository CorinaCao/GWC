      <div class="center"><font size="6"><p align="right"><center>Electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes, e-vaporizers, or electronic nicotine delivery systems, are battery-operated devices that people use to inhale an aerosol, which typically contains nicotine (though not always), flavorings, and other chemicals. They can resemble traditional tobacco cigarettes (cig-a-likes), cigars, or pipes, or even everyday items like pens or USB memory sticks. Other devices, such as those with fillable tanks, may lookdifferent.</center></font></div></p>

    <div class="center"><font size="4"><p align="left">They appear to be a safer alternative for long-term cigarette smokers who have been unable to successfully quit smoking using recommended and approved cessation aids.
They do not contain tobacco or as many of the other toxins and carcinogens that are the leading causes of lung disease and cancer in cigarette smokers.
They appear to be less risky to smokers who have mild to moderate cases of asthma.
They may emit less toxic material in their aerosol (less second and third-hand particulate matter).

They contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug that can lead to or perpetuate the use of other nicotine products, including cigarettes, as well as increase the risk of alcohol use, other drug use and addiction.

    <div class="center"><center>You can talk to your children or other young people you know about the dangers of e-cigarettes. Tell them about the harm that nicotine in any form can do to their growing brain. Let them know that you have a strong stance against them using any tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, now or in the future. Even if you have used tobacco yourself, they will listen if you discuss your struggles with nicotine addiction.</center></div>

    <div class="center"  <center>Proponents of e-cigarettes claim they’re safer than smoking because they don’t
      contain the more than 60 cancer-causing chemicals in tobacco smoke.
      But e-cigs still deliver harmful chemicals, including nicotine, the extremely addictive substance in cigarettes.
      And studies show that brands claiming to be “nicotine-free” may still have trace amounts.
      Developing teenage brains are especially sensitive to nicotine's addictive properties.</center></div>

    <div class="center"<center>  E-cigarette use poses a significant – and avoidable – health risk to young people in the United States. Besides increasing the possibility of addiction and long-term harm to brain development and respiratory health, e-cigarette use is associated with the use of other tobacco products that can do even more damage to the body. Even breathing e-cigarette aerosol that someone else has exhaled poses potential health risks.</center></div>
