<p><font size="+3"><b>What is an E-cigarette?</b></font></p>
<font size="+2">E-cigarettes are known by many different names such as e-cigs, e-hookahs, mods, vape pens, and vaporizers. Although e-cigarettes do not contain any tobacco, the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) classifies them as "tobacco" products. E-cigarettes come in a variety of shapes and sizes which is due to the size of the tank system or battery. They can look like cigarettes, cigars, pipes, pens, and USB flash drives. These devices operate by heating e-liquid(liquid nicotine) to a high enough temperature so that it produces an aerosal that is inhaled through the mouthpiece.</font>

  <center><font size="+2">This is one of the models that began the epidemic of e-cigarettes. These e-cigarettes were designed to imitate a tobacco cigarette having the end glow giving the user a sense of smoking a traditional cigarette.

  <center><font size="+2">These devices are a more complex and elaborated versions of the first generation devices. The latest additions generate functions that are beneficial yet harmful to the user. The capacity of the cartridge or tank is increased and the amount of nicotine in each cartridge can be controlled by the user. This can be beneficial because they can choose an e-cigarette with the least amount of nicotine. Yet, the user can also choose to intake higher levels of nicotine. This can also be a danger hazard because the user has the option to intake high levels of nicotine which can develop many health risks.</font></center>
